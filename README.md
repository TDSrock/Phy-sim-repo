# [](#header-1)Physics and Simulations

Within this repo is all the work I did for the Physics and Simulations class I followed at the end of my second semester. I'll add in a small section for each excersize. All of these excersizes were built within XNA.
Almost all of these excersizes were completed on stream. These are at the bottom of each pdf.

I know that the version shown at the end on this excersize was not my final version. If I can find it I will update this section to add it in.(aswell as adding it into the repository.)
